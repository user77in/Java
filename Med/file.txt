(Tagline: “Understand your medical bills. Don’t overpay.”)

1. Product Overview
Problem Statement

Medical bills are:

Confusing, non-transparent, and error-prone

Frequently incorrect (duplicate charges, miscoding, out-of-network errors)

Stressful for patients, who lack the expertise to audit them

Most consumers:

Do not understand CPT/ICD codes

Do not know their rights

Do not have time to call providers

As a result, people overpay thousands of dollars unnecessarily.

Solution

A self-serve B2C SaaS that:

Accepts medical bills (PDF/photo)

Automatically audits them for common billing errors

Explains issues in plain English

Generates ready-to-send dispute letters

Tracks resolution status

⚠️ No diagnosis. No treatment advice. No medical decisions.
